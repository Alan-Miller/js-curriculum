// ARROW FUNCTIONS

// #1 STUDENT CAN BUILD AND USE AN ARROW FUNCTION WITH ONE PARAMETER (NO PARENTHESES).
// 1.1
// Create a one line ES6 arrow function called isGreaterThanTwenty that will take in a parameter and return true if the parameter is greater than 20. The function should return false otherwise.  
//! Invoke your function, passing in 10, and save it in a variable called ten.
// You should not use the ES5 function declaration syntax in your final solution.
// Your function should not be longer than one line.
//! Your function should not use parentheses.
// Note: let and const do not working with these tests, you must use var.

// Code here


// #2 STUDENT CAN BUILD AND USE AN ARROW FUNCTION WITH NO PARAMETERS.
// 1.2
// Create a one line ES6 arrow function called seven that will return the number 7.  
//! Invoke your function and store the result in a variable called siete.
// You should not use the ES5 function declaration syntax in your final solution.
// Your function should not be longer than one line.
// Note: let and const do not working with these tests, you must use var.

// Code here



// #3 STUDENT CAN BUILD AND USE AN ARROW FUNCTION WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS.
// 1.4
// Create an ES6 arrow function called multiply that will take in two parameters and return the product of the two parameters.  
//! Invoke your function and store the return result in a variable called product.
// You should not use the ES5 function declaration syntax in your final solution.
// Note: let and const do not working with these tests, you must use var.


// #4 STUDENT CAN BUILD AND USE AN ARROW FUNCTION ON ONE LINE OF CODE WITH NO CURLY BRACKETS OR RETURN.
